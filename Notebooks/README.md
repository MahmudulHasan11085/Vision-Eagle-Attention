There are some issues need to be noted:
1. oracle-mnist-with-pytorch-resnet-only.ipynb and oracle-mnist-with-pytorch-resnet-attention.ipynb notebook have wrong class names. But it isn't an issue for the results as in the code the labels are fully numerical.
2. Original Split has been used. In that case some of the datasets, there were no different validation and testing set.
